# Chat App

Choose to be an Agent or a User to begin conversations. 

In this application, you start off by creating a User or an Agent. An Agent can view all available users and a User can view all available Agents. Clicking on an Agent or User name will open up a chat with them and you can have up to 3 open chats. It does not autoscroll to the bottom when you type a lot of messages so you have to manually scroll down ( one of many features I did not yet implement ). When an Agent is typing to a user, all other chat boxes will fade out so they can focus on finishing their message before getting to others (same for users).

# Installation instructions
- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- `npm run build` to install any updates/changes made to the `/src` files or folders
- `node server` to start a server on port 3000 ( `http://localhost:3000` )

From there you can test it out in the browser!
